Bug 1: Missing Search Functionality in Header

-Summary: The search trigger magnifying glass is not present in the header on the Estonia domain.

-Why we chose .ee: Testing was performed on the .ee domain because it is the local production environment for the current region, whereas the .lv domain listed in the assignment was used as a reference for required features.

-Steps to Reproduce:

   Navigate to https://www.optibet.ee/
   Observe the top-right header utility section.

-Expected Result: Search icon should be visible next to Login/Join buttons as seen in typical platform layouts.

-Actual Result: Only Help, Login, and Join buttons are visible.
-Severity: Medium
